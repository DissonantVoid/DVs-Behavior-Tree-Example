The example project from [your first behavior tree](https://github.com/DissonantVoid/DVs-Behavior-Tree/blob/main/addons/DVs_behavior_tree/docs/(3)%20your%20first%20behavior%20tree.md) meant to get new users familiar with [DVs behavior tree](https://github.com/DissonantVoid/DVs-Behavior-Tree) addon for Godot.

# How To Use
There are 2 branches in this repository. **main** contains the entire game with everything setup while **template** contains everything except for the boss AI implementation. If you're following the guide mentioned above go to the github releases of this repository and download the latest template.

# How To Update
This is mainly meant for me, the developer with a memory of a starfish and the urge to neatly organize and document everything but could help other contributers in the future.

- Updates are made to the main branch, when we reach a new version everything from **main** is merged into **template** minus the boss behavior files and the addon.
- The addon is included with **main** but not **template** to get users used to seting up the addon.
- Releases are made out of the **template** branch.
- Make sure that changes are reflected in the guide.
